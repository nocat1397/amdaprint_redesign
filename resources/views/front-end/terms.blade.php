                        <p><strong>Color Matching:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            VIBGYOR PRINTS LLC uses standard industry software for designing and printing purposes and sells products via a website accessed by internet-connected devices. There are differences in construction and configuration between computer screens and monitors. The fact that there is no true uniformity in standards to which monitors and screens must conform results in a variance in color from monitor to monitor, screen to screen. Further, monitors use light to display images and use a standard known as RGB. VIBGYOR PRINTS LLC produces colors on a variety of machines, none of which use light. As such, User agrees that VIBGYOR PRINTS LLC does not guarantee exact color matching or that printed colors will appear exactly as they do on User’s screen or monitor. Slight color variations are possible and will not be considered a production mistake and will not be eligible for refund or return or reproduction. VIBGYOR PRINTS LLC uses best judgment to match colors, but if you need visually matching colors, we suggest ordering sample product.
